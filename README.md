## Overview
DevOps Functionality Magnifier is a companion tool for the Visionaryx podcast, designed to reveal the complete functionality of DevOps and Cloud tools. It aligns with Visionaryx's core mission of enabling tools to converse with complete awareness of their capabilities.

## What is PartyRock?
PartyRock is AWS's no-code AI app builder platform that allows creation of generative AI applications without writing code. Learn more at [partyrock.aws](https://partyrock.aws).

## How It Works
The app uses ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) prompting methodology to perform deep technical analysis of DevOps tools. This approach:
1. Takes a tool name as input
2. Recursively analyzes its functionality
3. Explores under-the-hood implementations
4. Compiles comprehensive feature lists

## The Prompt
Here's the complete prompt used to create this app in PartyRock:

```plaintext
Create an app that deeply analyzes DevOps and Cloud tools' functionalities through ReAct prompting. The app should:

Input Interface:
- Two simple text input fields (both required) accepting any DevOps or Cloud tool names

Output Interface:
A single split-screen display with:
- Left panel: Complete functionality list for first tool
- Right panel: Complete functionality list for second tool

Analysis Process (happening behind the scenes):
Using ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) prompting for each tool:
1. Thought: What is [tool_name]'s complete functional scope?
2. Action: Deep-dive technical analysis
3. Output: Comprehensive functionality list

The output should be clean, simple lists of all functionalities discovered, nothing more. No categories, no explanations, no comparisons - just two parallel lists showing every single capability of each tool.

All analysis happens internally using ReAct methodology to ensure complete coverage of:
- Core functionalities
- Internal operations
- System capabilities
- Technical features
- Under-the-hood processes
- Deep implementation details

Description:
This app allows you to discover the complete functionality of any two DevOps or Cloud tools. Simply enter the names of the tools, and the app will use advanced AI analysis to generate comprehensive lists of all features, capabilities, and implementation details for each tool.

This application is built in alignment with one of Visionaryx podcast's core missions: enabling tools to converse with complete awareness of their full functionality. This vision emphasizes deep technical understanding in tool interactions.

By entering any DevOps or Cloud tool names, you'll receive exhaustive lists of their complete functionalities - a foundation for the upcoming podcast episodes where all DevOps and Cloud tools will engage in conversations, armed with knowledge of their capabilities, whether within their domain or beyond.
